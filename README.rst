Hello!  My name is Adam Traub.  Thanks for taking the time to read this.

I'm a Python dev so I decided to put the AI on the server side with python
and then sprinkle in some jquery goodness on the client side to make things
run smoothly and beautifully.

Running this application should be extremely easy.  I generally build my Django
apps on top of Google App Engine. If you're on a Linux machine, setting up
GAE can be a bit of a pain because the official instructions seem to end before
setup is complete.  This site has all the info you should need:

The game is very straight forward.  Click on a box to make your move.  If you'd
like to allow the AI to go first, simply click the button that says, "After you".
Naturally, I hide this button after the first move has been taken.

While I am a (new) fan of Bootstrap, I opted not to use it as I felt the
interface could be made reasonably responsive without it. I have another
Django application at: https://github.com/adtraub/isthatawordadam

Originally I created this application as a test for a company I was intending to
apply to, however, I received a job offer the day I intended to submit it.  While
I no longer intend to pursue the position for the company I created this for,
I see no reason not to leave it online and allow others to see it.  It's a nifty
little app, I'd say.

Tic-Tac-Toe makes for a fun coding Kata!
